Then make sure CMake is added to the path

Go to the root of this project, where the CMakeLists.txt is
And open up the Command line or Powershell here

Then type
 cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"
To generate a MinGW Makefile for the project - requires the MinGW compiler with C++ support
To build the project then type
 mingw32-make
